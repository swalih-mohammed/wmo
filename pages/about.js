        About WMO
        </Typography>

        It was like carving life out of solid, hard and tough realities. When Wayanad was soaked in the tears of poverty and disease, a group of people ventured to wipe them out. Their sole inspiration was the dedication and vision of Abdul Rahman Bafaqui Thangal. That was how, with an aim to bring the poor, ill and abandoned lives up to the light of life and hope, Wayanad Muslim Orphanage was built in 1967.

First, it was the shelter of a few orphans in Wayanad. And as four and a half decades sped past, WMO had already spread out its branches of care and love into an educational, social, entrepreneurial mission: riding on the course of contenting, yet unfulfilled mission. Beside the orphanage and hostel complex, WMO runs three colleges, Islamic educational institutions, schools, vocational enterprises etc. Ventures like dairy farm were started with a wider objective: the objective of reforming the traditional agricultural sector for the larger benefit of the agrarian economy of Wayanad. To all these initiatives has to be added the programs and ventures which reflect the WMO's social commitment.

        History
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="body1" gutterBottom>
        The first orphanages in Kerala have a history of being a quick, if well thought-out, social reaction to a political question. Often politics which brought orphanages into being was violent, echoed with turbulence and soaked with blood. It was from the ashes of the Malabar Revolt of 1922, which rendered many families devoid of their breadwinners, that the first Orphanage, JDT Islam, was founded in 1925. Similarly, following the Kudag Revolt of 1962, many men in the Wayand district vanished leaving only their names behind. The district was struck again by cholera, another notorious harbinger of death. Blood and tears flowed in quick succession. In a matter of five years; i.e. in 1967 Wayanad Muslim Orphanage was planted with a view of giving shelter and thereby wiping tears. It's an irony but fortune that violence and trauma often make love happen.

The name that symbolized love at that time was Sayyid Umar Bafaqui Thangal. WMO was his brainchild. It was started as the branch of Mukkam Muslim Orphanage with six children. With Umar Bafaqui Thangal were other leaders who stood by a people at the most unfortunate time of their life. Since 1972, WMO has started going on independently. In 1987, it came under the leadership of MA Muhammad Jamal. And beyond being a metaphor for shelter, care and love, WMO grew on to become a social, educational and entrepreneurial complex. The trust which runs WMO also includes Syed Hyder Ali Shihab Thangal as Patron; Kakkodan Musa Haji as president and KK Ahmad Haji as treasurer. In its chequered history of about half a century, WMO topped many charts: It started in the district the first higher secondary school and the vocational higher secondary school; the first recognized CBSE school; the first organized college for religious education; the first special school; hifz al-Quran college, Daras (a mosque-centered academy for religious learning) for those who learnt the Quran by heart. Around 260 products of WMO are pursuing higher learning in medicine and engineering and 55 of them are professionals in the government services.

What WMO aims is to mould a child, recognizing and respecting his/her multi-faceted personality and skills and providing a curricular and co-curricular ambience for them to nurture and grow. Students from nine states are now under the warmth and care of WMO. They make up 1394 in number. Around Rs 1.7 lakh is estimated for the daily expense of WMO. This is with the exception of expenses for construction and extension works etc. Mahal-based welfare committees and welfare committees in GCC are the major financial sources of WMO as well as those who value the three letters that symbolize love. Registered as per the Society Act (Reg. Number), WMO has a procedure to select the inmates. Orphans are received here at any time. The destitute are admitted on yearly basis and in urgent circumstances. WMO keeps its door open all days a year

        Mission & Vision
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="body1" gutterBottom>
        Coincidences made WMO happen. The unbearable burden of woes in the long history of Wayanad sprung a group of people into action. Their mission was simple: to be the surrogate parents of those whome chances denied parenthood and, as its very motto says, respect the child as a person.

Three decades WMO has travelled have altered its contours and expanded its horizons. Rather than being an educational complex, it has become an umbrella which brings under its shade a spectrum of activities aiming at society at large. Marriage meet which helps the poor girls in the region realize their nuptial dreams and Bafaqui Home which lends a helping hand to the poor patients lodged in the Mananthavady government hospital, the poorest hospital in the region, are the two initiatives proving our social commitment. We believe social action is a fluid activity: Always we will have to open ourselves to others.
We have kept this in our mind before we formulate the initiatives and programs to be achieved and started as Vision 2015
